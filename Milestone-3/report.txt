CSC425 Milestone-3 report

Each message has a header and a package, the header contains a type, and a length
The payload contains a char * to the number of bytes specified by the length
in the header. There are multiple types each message can be, HEARTBEAT specifies
that the message is simply a heart beat, this usually contains a length of 0
and does not include a payload, MESSAGE is the type that is used when the payload
needs to be delivered to the program. NEW_CONNECTION is used when the Client
is establishing a new connection to the Server. RECONNECT is used when the Client
is disconnected from the server and is Attempting to reconnect to the Server.
The serialized message looks like "%d%d%s" where the first digit is the type,
the second digit is the length of the payload, and the string of bytes was the
payload.
